# Testing_for_similarity_of_multivariate_mixed_outcomes
This repository contains the R code as well as the dataset of the case study used for the paper "Testing for similarity of multivariate mixed outcomes using generalised joint regression models with application to efficacy-toxicity responses".
The files "quiet_functions.R" and "EffTox_Functions.R" include internal functions. 
The simulation study is conducted using the files "simulation_binary.R", "simulation_continuous.R" and "simulation_mixed.R". 
The code for the case study ist stored in "case_study.R" and the corresponding dataset in "case_study_data.Rdata".
